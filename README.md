### Express Sequelize Blog 

Live Site: https://nodeexpresscms.herokuapp.com/

This project utilises express servers and Sequelize database to create a web app that allows users to create blog posts under their name and save them for future reading. It was first necessary to learn Sequelize by reading through the documents and apply my experience with MySQL. 

Then I set up models, which are representations of the database, and routes for getting, posting, and deleting data for posts and authors, which are connected through associations and foreign keys.
